I have recently published the [Properly typed Vuex Stores](https://viniciusteixeira.tk/2020/05/13/properly-typed-vuex-stores/) article and, as I thought of related subjects to talk about in other articles, I've decided to make it a series on Structuring Large Vue.js Applications.

These are the subjects I'm planning on discussing in this series:

- [Properly Typed Vuex Stores](https://viniciusteixeira.tk/2020/05/13/properly-typed-vuex-stores/) _published May 13, 2020_
- [Adopting TypeScript in your Vue.js Application in a sane way](https://viniciusteixeira.tk/2020/05/14/adopting-typescript-in-your-vue-application-in-a-sane-way/) _published May 14, 2020_
- [Modularizing the logic of your Vue.js Application](https://viniciusteixeira.tk/2020/05/15/modularizing-the-logic-of-your-vue-application/) _published May 15, 2020_
- [Data-driven components](https://viniciusteixeira.tk/2020/05/25/data-driven-components/) _published May 25, 2020_
- [Handling data at the edge of your Vue.js application](https://viniciusteixeira.tk/2020/06/01/handling-data-at-the-edge-of-your-vuejs-app/) _published June 1st, 2020_

So stay tuned and let me know if there are any other subjects related to this topic you would like me to address.
