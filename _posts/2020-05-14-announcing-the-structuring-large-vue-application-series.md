I have recently published the [Properly typed Vuex Stores](https://viniciusteixeira.tk/2020/05/13/properly-typed-vuex-stores/) article and, as I thought of related subjects to talk about in other articles, I've decided to make it a series on Structuring Large Vue.js Applications.

These are the subjects I'm planning on discussing in this series:

- [Properly Typed Vuex Stores](https://viniciusteixeira.tk/2020/05/13/properly-typed-vuex-stores/) _published May 13, 2020_
- [Adopting TypeScript in your Vue.js Application in a sane way](https://viniciusteixeira.tk/2020/05/14/adopting-typescript-in-your-vue-application-in-a-sane-way/) _published May 14, 2020_
- <ins>Modularizing the logic of your Vue.js Application</ins> _coming soon_
- <ins>Using services to establish a clear boundary in your Vue.js application</ins> _coming soon_

So stay tuned and let me know if there are any other subjects related to this topic you would like me to address.
